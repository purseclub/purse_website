## About PURSE CLUB
PURSE CLUB AKA WE like to think we are an eternal scrappy startup. We build products close to our hearts, and put everything weâ€™ve got into them, so the final products we deliver speak for themselves. Trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every great human achievement and consistently, its importance has been overlooked not just by individuals, but by entire societies. We felt it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves especially for the ones who live by this virtue: THE TRUSTWORTHY.

So we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for doing good and being trustworthy. This way, trust as a virtue becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be. Then we went one step ahead: we built it. Our workflow is not standard, and neither are we.
